            <h2>Pseudocode and Explanation</h2>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>First, I created a function called Solve that will help determine the number of
                    ways to represent a
                    given number Z. I start by addressing the simplest cases, which are the base
                    cases. If Z is less
                    than 2, there's only one way to represent it, so I had the function return 1 in
                    this case.</p>
                <p>Next, I made the function efficient by avoiding repeated calculations. To achieve
                    this, I used a
                    dictionary called memo to store results that are already computed. Before
                    performing any new
                    calculations, it checks if the result for the current Z is already in the memo.
                    If it is, it simply
                    returns that stored result.</p>
                <p>Now, the function handles the main part of the problem where it decides how to
                    split Z based on
                    whether it's even or odd:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Z is even, it breaks it down into two parts: Z/2 and (Z/2) - 1. It calls
                        Solve on both of
                        these parts and adds their results together.</li>
                    <li>If Z is odd, it simplifies the problem by solving for (Z - 1) / 2 instead.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>After calculating the result for the current Z, the function stores it in the
                    memo dictionary so it
                    can reuse the value later if needed. Finally, it returns the result.</p>
                <p>Hereâ€™s how it looks step-by-step in pseudocode:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Base Case: If Z is less than 2, return 1.</li>
                    <li>Memoization Check: If the result for Z is already in memo, return that
                        result.</li>
                    <li>Recursive Calculation:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If Z is even, set the result to Solve(Z / 2) + Solve((Z / 2) - 1).
                            </li>
                            <li>If Z is odd, set the result to Solve((Z - 1) / 2).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Store in Memo: Save the result in memo for future use.</li>
                    <li>Return Result: Return the computed result.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>By following these steps, I ensure the function is efficient and avoids
                    unnecessary calculations.
                    This method combines the simplicity of recursion with the power of memoization
                    to solve the problem
                    effectively. For a visual explanation, check out this video:</p>

            <h2>Understanding Base Algorithms</h2>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>The algorithm uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. The base case
                    checks if Z is less than
                    2, returning 1 since there's only one way to represent such numbers. For larger
                    values, the solution
                    splits into two cases based on the parity of Z. For even Z, the result is the
                    sum of the solutions
                    for Z/2 and (Z/2) - 1. For odd Z, it reduces to solving for (Z - 1) / 2.
                    Memoization is employed to
                    store and reuse computed results, significantly reducing redundant calculations.

            <h2>Why Divide Z into Z/2 and (Z/2) - 1 when Even, and (Z - 1)/2 when Odd?</h2>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>The division strategy of Z into Z/2 and (Z/2) - 1 when Z is even, and into (Z - 1)/2 when Z is odd,
                    is driven by the need to minimize redundant calculations and leverage the properties of the numbers
                    involved.</p>
                <h3>When Z is Even:</h3>
                <p>For even numbers, dividing Z into two parts: Z/2 and (Z/2) - 1, ensures that the problem is broken
                    into two subproblems with one even and one odd number. This strategy is beneficial because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduction of Redundant Calculations:</strong> By splitting into Z/2 and (Z/2) - 1, the
                        function avoids repeated calculations that might occur if both parts were even. Even numbers
                        tend to break down into smaller even numbers, leading to a repetitive pattern without much
                        variation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimal Subproblem Sizes:</strong> This division method ensures that the sizes of the
                        subproblems are balanced. By having one even and one odd part, the recursion tree becomes more
                        diverse, avoiding scenarios where the function repeatedly halves the number without making
                        substantial progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Memoization:</strong> This approach helps in efficiently storing and
                        retrieving results from the memoization dictionary. The diverse nature of the subproblems
                        increases the likelihood that previously computed results can be reused, reducing the overall
                        number of calculations needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>When Z is Odd:</h3>
                <p>For odd numbers, simplifying the problem by solving for (Z - 1) / 2 is effective because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simplification to an Even Number:</strong> Subtracting one from an odd number makes it
                        even. Even numbers are generally easier to handle and split further, making the problem more
                        manageable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced Approach:</strong> This approach ensures that the recursive steps are
                        consistent and balanced, maintaining a steady reduction in the problem size.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> By handling the odd case in this manner, the complexity of
                        the recursive function is kept in check, ensuring that the function converges more quickly to
                        the base case.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, this strategy of dividing Z into one even and one odd part when Z is even, and reducing by
                    one to handle odd numbers, strikes a balance between complexity and efficiency. It ensures that the
                    recursive function makes consistent progress and that the memoization dictionary can be used
                    effectively to minimize redundant calculations.</p>

            <h2>Algorithm Space/Time Complexity</h2>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h3>Time Complexity</h3>
                <p>The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log n), where n is the value of Z. This
                    is because Solve is
                    called recursively for Z/2 and Z/2 â€“ 1 if Z is even and (Z-1)/2 if Z is odd.</p>
                <h3>Space Complexity</h3>
                <p>The space complexity is also O(log n) due to the storage requirements of the memo
                    dictionary, which
                    holds the results for each value from 0 to Z.</p>

            <h2>Explanation for Z = 12</h2>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <p>Let's explain how to get the answer for ( Z = 12 ) in a simple way:</p>
                <p>Imagine you have a set of special coins, each with values like 1, 2, 4, and 8. To
                    figure out how many
                    different ways you can make 12 using these coins, we break it down into smaller
                    parts and use some
                    math magic (called recursion and memoization) to avoid doing the same
                    calculations over and over.
                </p>
                <p>First, since 12 is even, we split it into 6 (which is half of 12) and 5 (one less
                    than half of 12).
                    Then, we do the same for 6 and 5, and keep going until we get to numbers like 1
                    and 0, which are
                    really easy to handle. By combining all these smaller parts, we find out there
                    are 7 ways to make 12
                    using these special coins. It's like building with LEGO blocks, starting with
                    smaller pieces and
                    putting them together to form the final structure.</p>
